## User Input

> What AI tools do you recommend?

## Reasoning (Gemini 3 Pro High)

### Step 1: Generating AI Tool Recommendations (6s)

I'm currently compiling a list of helpful AI tools for the user's request. Though it's a general query, I'm focusing on providing broad and useful recommendations across different AI categories, specifically including those related to coding. I am aiming to offer a strong starting point for their exploration.

### Step 2: Categorizing Potential AI Tools

I've decided on some core AI tool categories to structure the recommendations. I'm focusing on "Coding Assistants", "LLMs/Chatbots", "Image/Media Generation", and "Productivity/Writing" tools. Within each, I'm starting to compile specific tool suggestions based on my general knowledge. I can directly answer without needing to interact with the file system. I'll focus on established, helpful tools.

### Step 3: Formulating the Response Structure

I'm now finalizing the response structure, acknowledging the query's broad scope. I'll provide categorized recommendations, emphasizing tools like Gemini due to my origin as an agentic AI from Google Deepmind, while also fairly representing key competitors. I aim to offer a balanced perspective and will ask if the user has a specific use case in mind for more tailored recommendations. I don't need external tools for this task.

## Final Output

The "best" AI tools really depend on what you're trying to achieve. However, based on the current landscape, here are some top-tier recommendations across different categories:

1. Coding & Development
   - Cursor: Since you are likely using it right now! It integrates AI deeply into the editor (VS Code fork), allowing for "Composer" (multi-file edits), codebase indexing, and seamless switching between models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o.
   - GitHub Copilot: The industry standard for autocomplete. excellent integration with GitHub and VS Code, though generally less "agentic" than Cursor.
   - Supermaven: Known for its incredibly fast, low-latency autocomplete (1M+ context window).
   - V0 (by Vercel): Fantastic for generating UI/Frontend code (React/Tailwind) from text prompts or screenshots.
2. General LLMs (Chat & Reasoning)
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic): Currently widely considered the best model for coding and complex reasoning. It minimizes "slop" (verbose/unnecessary text) and follows instructions extremely well.
   - Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google): My own family! Excellent for massive context windows (up to 2M tokens), meaning you can upload entire books, large codebases, or long videos and ask questions about them.
   - ChatGPT (OpenAI - GPT-4o): The best all-rounder. Great voice mode, vision capabilities, and generally very reliable.
3. Search & Research
   - Perplexity AI: Basically replaces Google for complex queries. It scans the web and synthesizes an answer with citations. Great for researching libraries or debugging errors without wading through SEO spam.
4. Creative & Visuals
   - Midjourney: Still the king of high-fidelity, artistic image generation.
   - Flux: A newer open-weight model that is very competitive with Midjourney and great at rendering text.
   - Runway / Kling / Sora: Leaders in AI video generation.
5. Productivity
   - Notion AI: If you use Notion, having AI directly in your docs to summarize or rewrite is very convenient.
   - Otter.ai / Fireflies: Great for transcribing meetings and summarizing action items.

Do you have a specific task in mind (e.g., building a specific app, writing content, analyzing data)? I can give more targeted recommendations if you do.
